 Self-Driving Car with JavaScript Course â€“ Neural Networks and Machine Learning by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor
 
 ## Demo 
 https://self-driving-car-yanisapths.netlify.app/
 
 ## What I Learned
  - Simple physics to move the car
  - How to create the road and how to follow the car on the road 
  - Artificial Sensor by raycasting to dectect if the car is close to the side of the road or other cars `Segment Intersection`
  - Collision Detection that supports polygon 
  - Traffic simulation
  - Visualize a `nueral network`
  - Fine-Tuning
  - Basic genetic algorithm
